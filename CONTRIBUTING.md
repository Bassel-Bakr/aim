# Contributing to Aim Wiki

Thank you for helping. This guide explains how to add or change wiki pages.

It covers the wiki at `/wiki` only. [Articles](#articles-are-not-part-of-the-wiki) at `/articles` are
signed, authored pages and are not open to contributions.

## Ways to contribute

- Fix a mistake: click the edit button (pencil icon) on any wiki page. GitHub opens the file so you
  can propose a change.
- Add a page or a large change: open an issue first, so we can agree on scope.

## Run the site locally

Follow the steps in [README.md](README.md#run-the-site-locally).

## Add a page

1. Copy a template from `templates/`:
   - `concept.md` for pages that explain aim concepts or training advice.
   - `resource.md` for pages about a community, a trainer, or a tool.

   `templates/article.md` is not a wiki template; see
   [Articles are not part of the wiki](#articles-are-not-part-of-the-wiki).
2. Save the file in the matching folder under `docs/wiki/`. (`docs/index.md` is the site's landing page, not a wiki page.)
3. Add the page to the `nav` list in `zensical.toml`.
4. Link the new page from at least one related page.

Page titles come from the `title:` field in the front matter. Do not add a `#` heading in the page
body.

## Describe the page

Every page carries a `description:` in front matter, on one folded line:

```yaml
description: >-
  How sensitivity works, how to find one that suits you, and why changing it constantly costs you
  progress.
```

That line is the page's meta description, the text under its search result, and the blurb on the
card shown when someone pastes the link into Discord or a social network. A page without one is
listed under the site's own description instead of its subject, so `scripts/check_pages.py`
requires it.

Write it for someone deciding whether to open the page:

- 50 to 160 characters. Search engines cut it off around 160.
- Say what the page answers, in the words a reader would search, not "This page covers…".
- Leave out the site name. The template adds it.
- No two pages share a description. Each one describes its own subject.

## Writing rules

1. Write in your own words and link to the original source. Do not copy guides, tables, or images
   from other sites.

   Keeping a source's sentence and swapping a few words is still copying, and it is the easy
   mistake to make, because the result reads as though you wrote it. Work out what the source
   claims, then say that from scratch. Where the exact wording is the point, such as a term whose
   definition is disputed, quote it in quotation marks and attribute it:

   ```markdown
   Matty defines it as a deliberate choice to "withhold extra motion on a target."[^matty]
   ```
2. Cite facts with a reference. Every source lives once in `references.yml` at the repository root,
   under a stable ID. Put that ID as a footnote marker at the end of the sentence, and do not define
   it on the page:

   ```markdown
   Fingers make small adjustments and the arm drives large turns.[^REF-15]
   ```

   The site fills in the source's name and link, and links it to its entry on the
   [References](docs/wiki/references.md) page. To cite a source that is not in the registry yet, add
   it with the next unused ID:

   ```yaml
   - id: REF-58
     author: Aimlabs
     title: Wrist aiming vs arm aiming: why not both?
     url: https://aimlabs.com/articles/aimlabs/wrist-aiming-vs-arm-aiming-why-not-both/
     type: article
   ```

   `author` is the person or organization; `type` is one of article, document, documentation,
   encyclopedia, post, repository, study, video, or website. `publication` and `notes` are
   optional. Never renumber or reuse an ID: pages cite by ID. Footnotes are numbered in the order a
   page cites them.

   Where one sentence rests on several sources, put the markers one after another, with nothing
   between them, the way an encyclopedia stacks them:

   ```markdown
   Tense to start a fast motion, then release before you land.[^REF-77][^REF-74]
   ```

   A space, a comma, or an "and" between markers reads as part of the sentence, so
   `scripts/check_pages.py` rejects it.

   A footnote that is not a source, such as a short aside, still works the normal way: give it any
   label other than a `REF-` ID and define it at the bottom of the page.

   Two exceptions stay in the prose rather than becoming references: links to other wiki pages,
   which are navigation rather than citation, and cases where the source's identity is part of the
   claim, such as whose benchmark a rank belongs to.

   Outside those exceptions, do not name the source in the sentence as well. The footnote already
   says who, and "a coach recommends", "an article notes" only stands between the reader and the
   point. State the claim or the advice directly and let the marker carry the source. Where sources
   disagree, set the approaches side by side, each with its own citation, rather than naming who
   holds which.
3. Pages written from research but not yet fact-checked keep this banner at the top:

   ```markdown
   !!! warning "Draft"
       Written from public sources, pending review.
   ```

4. If you cannot verify a claim from a public source, leave it out, or mark it with
   `<!-- REVIEW: what needs checking -->`. HTML comments are hidden on the page but still visible
   in the page source.

## Readability

Most people reading this wiki skim, and many read with ADHD. A page has to work when it is read in
passes, so every page under `docs/wiki/` follows four rules:

1. **Paragraphs run 45 words at most**, and so does each list item. One idea per paragraph. A bold
   lead-in counts toward the paragraph it opens.
2. **Sentences run 25 words at most**, in lists as well as prose.
3. **A concept page opens with its answer:** three to five bullets before its first `##` heading. A
   reader who stops there still has the point.
4. **A concept page ends on one next action:** a paragraph opening `**Do this next.**` before
   `## Resources`, giving a reader who lost the thread somewhere to go. The Related section is added
   between the two.

Concept pages are those in `getting-started`, `fundamentals`, `categories`, `techniques`, and
`training`, other than `index.md`. [How Aim Works](docs/wiki/fundamentals/how-aim-works.md) shows
all four rules on a real page.

Write in US English, as the sources do: `practice` as a verb, `organize`, `behavior`. Footnote
definitions keep a source's own spelling, because they quote its title.

None of this means a casual voice. Keep the register plain and technical, and keep every fact.

When you restructure an existing page, do not rename a heading, add or remove a link or a footnote,
or touch the front matter. Other pages link to headings, and a link that falls out of a split
sentence is easy to miss in a diff. `scripts/check_rewrite.py` compares a page against an earlier
commit and reports anything of that kind:

```bash
python scripts/check_rewrite.py main docs/wiki/glossary.md
```

To move or rename a page, never move the file by hand. `scripts/move_page.py` moves it and repoints
every relative link to it, the `related:` entries that list it, and its `nav` entry. It also adds a
redirect from the old URL, so links from outside the wiki keep working:

```bash
python scripts/move_page.py wiki/categories/tracking.md wiki/skills/tracking.md
```

It ends by checking that every link in `docs/` resolves, and lists any other mention of the old
path, such as in a template, for you to update by hand. Links stay ordinary relative Markdown, so
they work on GitHub and in editors as well as on the site.

## Articles are not part of the wiki

Articles live at `/articles`, outside `docs/wiki/`, because they run on a different trust model. A
wiki page earns trust by citing a public source for each claim, and anyone may correct it. An
article earns trust by carrying its author's name, and is not open to contributions. Keeping them in
separate trees means neither set of rules needs an exception clause for the other.

Nothing in this document applies to articles. They are written by the site's maintainer from
`templates/article.md`, carry a `!!! info "Written by <name>"` byline instead of the draft banner,
take no tags, and do not require footnotes. `scripts/check_pages.py` enforces those rules for
anything under `docs/articles/`.

To suggest an article, or a correction to one, open an issue rather than a pull request.

## How a wiki page ends

A concept page ends with up to three sections, in this order, each with one job:

1. **Related**: other wiki pages that connect to this one. Required on concept and resource
   pages. Do not write this section: list the pages in front matter, each with a reason, and it is
   added above Resources with each page's current title:

   ```yaml
   related:
     - page: wiki/training/routines.md
       why: turning these habits into a session plan.
   ```

   Paths are relative to `docs/`. Links between two concept pages, or two resource pages, run both
   ways on their own: when this page lists another one that does not list it back, that page's
   Related section gains a bare link back here. Give it a reason by adding this page to that page's
   list. A resource page listing a concept page stays one-way, and so does a link to a page with
   no related list, such as the Glossary. A live preview only re-renders the page you edited, so
   run `zensical build --clean` to see a new link back on the other page.

   To find pages worth listing, run `python scripts/suggest_related.py <page>`. It prints entries
   to paste, strongest first: pages that already link here, pages linked in this page's text, and
   pages sharing two or more tags. Each carries `why: TODO`; write the reason or drop the entry, since
   the checker rejects a TODO.
2. **Resources**: where to go to learn more — resource pages, and the matching section of
   [Guides](docs/wiki/resources/guides.md). These are recommendations, not evidence.
3. **References**: the sources for this page's claims. Do not write this heading: it is added
   automatically, with the cited sources under it, on any page that cites one.

Keep the two kinds of external link apart. A link that supports a claim on the page is a
reference and becomes a footnote. A link that is simply good material on the subject is a
resource; it goes on Guides, not into this page's footnotes.

## The Guides page

`docs/wiki/resources/guides.md` catalogues external learning material — guides, videos,
playlists, documents, posts — grouped by what it helps with, never by format. It works differently
from the rest of the wiki in two ways.

The entry is the citation. A line there names the piece, its publisher, and its year where the
source states one, so it takes no footnote; adding one would double every line.

A link earns its place by teaching something: a method, a mechanism, or a mistake. A benchmark
announcement, a score sheet, or a routine handed over without an explanation of how to play it is
not educational content and belongs on the relevant resource page instead. Prefer a primary source
over a re-upload, never add a mirror of someone else's document, and keep an entry only while it
still resolves. Write the one-line description in your own words, as the rest of the wiki requires.

## Tags

Use only these tags in the `tags:` front matter field:

- Type (resource pages only): `community`, `trainer`, `tool`
- Topic: `clicking`, `tracking`, `switching`, `benchmarks`, `routines`, `sensitivity`, `beginner`,
  `myth`

To propose a new tag, open an issue.

## Glossary

Add new terms to `docs/wiki/glossary.md`. If the term is an abbreviation, also add it to
`includes/abbreviations.md`, so the site shows its meaning as a tooltip on every page.

## Check before you open a pull request

```bash
python scripts/check_pages.py
zensical build --clean
```

Both commands must finish without problems. The same checks run automatically on every pull request.
