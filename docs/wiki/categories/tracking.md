!!! warning "Draft"
    Written from public sources, pending review.

Tracking is keeping your crosshair on a target that's already moving, rather than acquiring it fresh
or hopping to the next one.

- **Precise:** the path is readable. Stay exactly on it.
- **Reactive:** the path isn't readable. Respond to each change as it happens.
- **Control:** direction changes are rounded. Switch between the two modes as the path demands.
- **Match the target's speed.** Don't lag behind and snap forward to catch up.

[Aimlabs](../resources/trainers/aimlabs.md) describes it as making sure your "crosshair remains
glued to your opponents." That matters most in longer engagements, where a target stays alive and
mobile.[^REF-11]

What makes one track harder than another is mostly how readable the target's path is.

A target moving along a smooth, predictable line asks you to hold position accurately. A target
that changes direction without warning asks you to respond to each change as it happens.

Those are different demands, and the benchmark communities separate them the same way.
[Voltaic](../resources/communities/voltaic.md)'s Season 5 KovaaK's benchmark names the three cases
below precise, reactive, and control.[^REF-50]

[Aimlabs](../resources/trainers/aimlabs.md) frames the same split as "pure horizontal tracking and
smoothness" against "raw reactivity and target reading."[^REF-14]

## Precise tracking

Precise tracking is the readable case. The target moves smoothly along a path you can read ahead of
time. The difficulty is staying exactly on it, not reacting to surprises.

Voltaic scores it on scenarios built around small targets, where the crosshair has to arrive and
settle without wobbling. A target that small leaves nowhere to hide a correction.[^REF-50]

Good execution means the crosshair moves at the same rate as the target, instead of lagging and
snapping forward to catch up. That's the smoothness quality covered in more depth on
[How Aim Works](../fundamentals/how-aim-works.md).

The common mistake is over-correcting a small mismatch, which turns a smooth track into a series of
jerky snaps. Train it on slower, predictable paths first. Hold a clean continuous track before
adding speed or unpredictability.

## Reactive tracking

Reactive tracking is the unreadable case. The target changes direction and speed without a readable
pattern, so the task shifts from smoothness to reading each change as it happens.

Good execution means tracking where the target actually is, rather than anticipating where it's
going. Prediction looks tighter right up until an opponent changes direction to bait it. Then it
fails outright. See [How Aim Works](../fundamentals/how-aim-works.md) on reacting versus predicting.

The common mistake is exactly that: predicting a pattern instead of reacting to it. It works only
until the target breaks the pattern.

Train it with scenarios that deliberately vary target direction. Treat any target whose path you can
fully predict as too easy to be useful practice for this category.

## Control tracking

Control tracking sits between the two. Voltaic added it in Season 5 as a hybrid category "bridging
traditional subcategory gaps." The target strafes on all three axes, but its changes of direction
are rounded rather than sharp.[^REF-50]

Real targets rarely sit at either extreme. Tracking movement like this means switching between the
two modes as the path demands. Stay smooth through the parts you can read, and react cleanly when it
changes.

The common mistake is defaulting entirely to one mode. Either you smooth through direction changes
you should react to, or you over-react to motion that is actually smooth and predictable.

Scenarios built for this tend to use rounded direction changes rather than sharp ones. That's what
makes them a bridge between the two.

**Do this next.** Start with precise tracking on a slow, predictable path, and add speed only once
you can hold a clean continuous track.
